# Pizza-Runner-Case-Study-Project

👋 About this Project

This project is inspired by Danny Ma’s 8-Week SQL Challenge, specifically the Pizza Runner case study. It analyzes a fictional pizza delivery startup’s operations to uncover actionable insights that can help improve performance, customer retention, and profitability.


🗂 Project Deliverables

SQL Scripts: sol_part1.sql to sol_part5.sql
Covers data cleaning, transformation, performance analysis, customer insights, and runner performance.

Cleaned CSV Files:
Contains organized tables such as customer_orders.csv, runner_orders.csv, pizzas.csv, extras.csv for easy reuse.

Excel Report:
Validates SQL outputs with static tables, pivots, and basic charts to show raw vs. cleaned data.

Power BI Dashboard (.pbix):
Fully interactive visual dashboard with key metrics, trend analysis, and a dedicated insights page summarizing findings and recommendations.


📊 Key Metrics & Visuals

Core KPIs: Total Sales, Orders Delivered, Pizzas Delivered, Cancellation Rate.

Customer Insights: Top customers by total spend, orders per customer.

Product Insights: Popular pizza types, most common extras and exclusions.

Operational Performance: Average runner speed, average runner rating.

Trend Analysis: Orders by weekday, peak sales days.


💡 Insights & Recommendations

Cancellations: ~20% of orders were cancelled.
→ Recommendation: Improve runner availability and customer communication to reduce cancellations.

Top Pizza: Meat Lovers Pizza accounts for ~75% of sales.
→ Recommendation: Prioritize marketing campaigns and upselling strategies for this top-selling item.

Peak Sales Day: Wednesday has the highest order volume.
→ Recommendation: Schedule more runners or prep staff to maintain delivery speed on peak days.

Runner Performance: Runner ID 2 consistently achieves the highest average delivery speed.
→ Recommendation: Assign this runner to longer or urgent deliveries to maximize on-time performance.

Customer Value: Customer ID 104 contributed ~25% of total sales.
→ Recommendation: Design loyalty programs or special offers to retain and reward high-value customers.

Order Customization: Extra bacon is the most common addition; cheese is the most common exclusion.
→ Recommendation: Optimize the prep and menu process for these customizations — consider a “No Cheese” option and highlight bacon as a popular add-on.
